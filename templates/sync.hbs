  <h1>Backing up your content</h1>
  <p>We've begun backing up your content. The status of your Dropbox and social network accounts will be updated live below.</p>
  <div class="tip">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Closing or navigating away from this page will not stop the backup process. You can pause or restart each network's backup individually by using their respective controls below, or <a {{action 'pauseAllSources'}}>pause them all</a>. We will automatically back up any new content you post to these networks in the future as well unless you pause them.</p>
